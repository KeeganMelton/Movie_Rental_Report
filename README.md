<h2>Scenario:</h2>
You are a data analyst for a small DVD rental chain. Upper Management has asked you to constuct a report to help awnser a real-world buisness quesion. The report can be anything as long as it can be the answers to a buisness question.

For this assignment, I've chosen to create a report that will highlight customers status for a new rewards program based on the number of rentals each customer has made. This gives the business an opportunity to reward reoccurring customers and incentivize new customers to return.
